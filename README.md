## NightWatcher314 builds

Install this fork's self-built release through `brew install nightwatcher314/formula/yabai`.
Starting with v7.1.32, our release binaries use a persistent self-signed Code Signing certificate.
The private key stays in the publisher's local keychain; release assets contain only the signed executable.
The Apple notarization statements below describe Christian-SC26's releases.

For upgrades to retain Accessibility permission, keep the same certificate and signing identifier, and use
`/opt/homebrew/var/yabai/yabai` for both launchd and the permission entry on Apple Silicon
(`/usr/local/var/yabai/yabai` on Intel Homebrew). The formula installs a real executable at that stable path; bin/opt symlinks resolve to a versioned Cellar path. The first move to this identity still requires authorization.
Build releases with `bash scripts/release.sh`; it pins the certificate fingerprint and refuses to fall back to ad-hoc signing.

v7.1.31 restores three scripting-addition interfaces on macOS 27.0, validated on build 26A428.
The capability handshake is 0x7f, and desktop reordering and same-app window focus were exercised and restored.
Ordinary cross-app activation uses the existing main-program path. macOS 27.1/27.2 keep the disabled patterns;
cross-display desktop movement and execution on arm64e.x1 hardware still need live validation.
See [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for validation and the tap README for installation, permissions and upgrades.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### 🚀 Community Maintenance Fork (macOS 27 Golden Gate & Critical Fixes)
> This repository is an actively maintained fork created to provide timely fixes, critical stability improvements, and **macOS 27 (Golden Gate)** compatibility in the absence of upstream maintainer activity.
>
> **Issues resolved in this fork:**
> * **⚡ Instant Space Switching with SIP Enabled (SIP ON) on macOS 27 (Golden Gate)**:
>   * Instant, glitch-free space switching (`yabai -m space --focus <index|recent|prev|next>`) out-of-the-box with **System Integrity Protection (SIP) fully enabled** — **no SIP disabling or scripting addition injection required**!
>   * Employs reverse-engineered IOHIDSystemQueue fluid touch gesture serialization (field 4205 payload) directly into `Dock.app` with calibrated multi-step phase timing for instant multi-space jumps;
>   * Completely avoids duplicate/ghost window rendering across spaces and eliminates menu bar stacking/artifacts by synchronizing through Dock's native space pipeline;
>   * Seamlessly falls back to scripting addition payload when SIP is disabled.
> * **macOS 27 (Golden Gate) Full Compatibility** ([#2824](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2824)):
>   * Updated Mach-O opcode scanner and payload injection for macOS 27 `Dock.app`;
>   * Corrected `scripting_addition_perform_validation()` verification (`attrib = 0x7f`).
> * **Dedicated Thread for Mouse Event Tap** ([#2829](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2829)):
>   * Runs `CGEventTap` on its own dedicated `pthread` with private `CFRunLoop`, completely eliminating delayed or dropped mouse clicks when heavy applications stall the Accessibility API on the main thread.
> * **Launchd Restart Loop Guard & Legacy Service Migration** ([#2808](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2808)):
>   * Automatically unloads, disables, and deletes legacy `com.koekeishiya.yabai` launchd agent on service commands (`--install-service`, `--start-service`, `--restart-service`, `--stop-service`);
>   * Reports the PID of an already-running yabai process and exits cleanly with code `0` to prevent launchd runaway respawn loops and multi-gigabyte log files.
> * **Window Close BSP Gap Elimination & Auto-Healing** ([#2828](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2828)):
>   * Full tree root flush on window un-tile so remaining windows automatically expand to fill freed space;
>   * Space validation on `WINDOW_FOCUSED` and `APPLICATION_FRONT_SWITCHED` cleans up zombie windows and restores proper tiling immediately upon closing windows (`Cmd+W`).
> * **Reliable BSP Retiling on Fullscreen Exit** ([#2758](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2758), [#2576](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2576), [#2653](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2653), [#2716](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2716)):
>   * Exiting native fullscreen or zoom-fullscreen now reliably re-integrates windows into the BSP layout;
>   * Fixes premature clearing of `WINDOW_MOVABLE` and debouncing false alarms during system transition animations.
> * **`external_bar` Consideration in Windowed Fullscreen** ([#2776](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2776)):
>   * Toggling `windowed-fullscreen` mode now honors configured top and bottom padding for external status bars (e.g., Sketchybar).
> * **Per-App Focus-Follows-Mouse Exclusion Rule** ([#2750](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2750)):
>   * Added `ffm=off` / `focus_follows_mouse=off` rule option to prevent focus from jumping to or from excluded apps (such as virtual machines, games, or graphic editors) when the mouse passes over them.
> * **Prevent Space Jump on Sticky & PiP Window Focus** ([#2825](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2825)):
>   * When `skip_window_focus_animation` is enabled, focusing or clicking sticky windows (such as YouTube Picture-in-Picture players in Safari/Chrome or floating utility overlays) no longer erroneously triggers a space-switching gesture to the application's background space.
> * **Fix Frame Recalculation When Warping Sole Window Between Spaces** ([#2817](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2817)):
>   * When dragging and dropping the only window on a space to warp into a window on another display or space (`mouse_drop_action warp`), the target window and newly moved window now properly capture their geometries and animate smoothly instead of freezing at their old bounds.
> * **Scratchpad Toggle Space Jumping Fix** ([#2807](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2807)):
>   * Synchronized window space movement before focus change, preventing yabai from snapping back to the previous space when toggling a scratchpad window.
> * **Smooth Live 60 FPS Mouse Resizing & Real-Time Border Dragging** ([#2712](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2712), [#2714](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2714)):
>   * Upgraded mouse drag rate-limiting from ~15 FPS (67.67 ms) to smooth 60 FPS (16 ms) with delta-distance thresholding;
>   * Resizing tiled BSP windows now adjusts sibling fences in real-time as the cursor moves instead of waiting for mouse release.
> * **Save & Restore Workspace Sessions & Layouts** ([#902](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/902)):
>   * Added `yabai -m space --save-session [<name|path>]`, `yabai -m space --load-session [<name|path>]`, and `yabai -m space --dump-session` to snapshot and restore your entire multi-display workspace (all spaces, space types, paddings, window trees, and open applications);
>   * Added `yabai -m space --save-layout [<name|path>]`, `yabai -m space --load-layout [<name|path>]`, and `yabai -m space --dump-layout` for individual space layout templates.
> * **🍏 Apple Developer ID Signed & Apple Notarized Binaries**:
>   * Official release binaries published on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Christian-SC26/yabai/releases) page are digitally signed with an official Apple Developer ID certificate using Hardened Runtime and ticketed by the Apple Notary Service (`xcrun notarytool`).
>   * macOS Gatekeeper verifies the ticket automatically—no security blocks, quarantine prompts, or manual `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` workarounds needed.


## About

<img align="right" width="40%" src="assets/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot">

yabai is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS.
yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using [&nearr;&nbsp;skhd][gh-skhd] and other third-party software.

The primary function of yabai is tiling window management; automatically modifying your window layout using a binary space partitioning algorithm to allow you to focus on the content of your windows without distractions.
Additional features of yabai include focus-follows-mouse, disabling animations for switching spaces, creating spaces past the limit of 16 spaces, and much more.

## Installation and Configuration

### Pre-built Signed & Notarized Binaries (Recommended)

Universal release binaries (`arm64` Apple Silicon + `x86_64` Intel) are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Christian-SC26/yabai/releases) page.
- **Apple Notarized**: Every official release archive is signed with Apple Developer ID and fully notarized by Apple. Gatekeeper allows running them immediately.
- Quick install via release installer script:
  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Christian-SC26/yabai/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
  ```
- Or download `yabai-v*.tar.gz` directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Christian-SC26/yabai/releases), extract it, and place `yabai` into your `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin`).

### Documentation and Configuration
- The [&nearr;&nbsp;yabai&nbsp;wiki][yabai-wiki] has both brief and detailed installation instructions for multiple installation methods, and also explains how to uninstall yabai completely.
- Sample configuration files can be found in the [&nearr;&nbsp;examples][yabai-examples] directory. Refer to the [&nearr;&nbsp;documentation][yabai-docs] or the wiki for further information.
- Keyboard shortcuts can be defined with [&nearr;&nbsp;skhd][gh-skhd] or any other suitable software you may prefer.

## Requirements and Caveats

Please read the below requirements carefully.
Make sure you fulfil all of them before filing an issue.

|Requirement|Note|
|-:|:-|
|Operating&nbsp;System&nbsp;Intel x86-64|Big Sur 11.0.0+, Monterey 12.0.0+, Ventura 13.0.0+, Sonoma 14.0.0+, Sequoia 15.0+, Tahoe 26.0+, and Golden Gate 27.0+ is supported.|
|Operating&nbsp;System&nbsp;Apple Silicon|Monterey 12.0.0+, Ventura 13.0.0+, Sonoma 14.0.0+, Sequoia 15.0+, Tahoe 26.0+, and Golden Gate 27.0+ is supported.|
|Accessibility&nbsp;API|yabai must be given permission to utilize the Accessibility API and will request access upon launch. The application must be restarted after access has been granted.|
|Screen Recording|yabai must be given Screen Recording permission if and only if you want to enable window animations, and will request access when necessary. The application must be restarted after access has been granted.|
|System&nbsp;Preferences&nbsp;(macOS 11.x, 12.x)|In the Mission Control pane, the setting "Displays have separate Spaces" must be enabled.|
|System&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;(macOS 13.x, 14.x, 15.x, 26.x, 27.x)|In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Mission Control pane, the setting "Displays have separate Spaces" must be enabled.|

Please also take note of the following caveats.

|Caveat|Note|
|-:|:-|
|System&nbsp;Integrity&nbsp;Protection (Optional)|System Integrity Protection can be (partially) disabled if you wish to inject the scripting addition into Dock.app for advanced window server manipulation. Note: **Instant space switching (`yabai -m space --focus <index>`) works cleanly out-of-the-box with SIP fully enabled (SIP ON)** on macOS 27 Golden Gate without needing scripting addition injection.|
|Code&nbsp;Signing|When building from source (or installing from HEAD), it is necessary to codesign the binary so it retains its accessibility and automation privileges when updated or rebuilt.|
|Finder&nbsp;Desktop|Some people disable the Finder Desktop window using an undocumented defaults write command. This breaks focusing of empty spaces and should be avoided when using yabai. To re-activate the Finder Desktop, run: "defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true".|
|NSDocument-based&nbsp;Applications|Windows that utilize native macOS tabs such as Terminal and Finder, [do not behave correctly when creating tabs](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/68). Avoid creating tabs in these applications, consider alternatives that do not use NSDocument's tab system, or make these windows float using rules.|
|System&nbsp;Preferences&nbsp;(macOS 11.x, 12.x)|In the Mission Control pane, the setting "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use" should be disabled for commands that rely on the ordering of spaces to work reliably.|
|System&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;(macOS 13.x, 14.x, 15.x, 26.x)|In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Mission Control pane, the setting "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use" should be disabled for commands that rely on the ordering of spaces to work reliably.|
|System&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;(macOS 14.x, 15.x, 26.x)|In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Desktop & Stage Manager pane, the setting "Show Items On Desktop" should be enabled for display and space focus commands to work reliably in multi-display configurations.|
|System&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;(macOS 14.x, 15.x, 26.x)|In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Desktop & Stage Manager pane, the setting "Click wallpaper to reveal Desktop" should be set to "Only in Stage Manager" for display and space focus commands to work reliably.|
